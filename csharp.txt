variables

local variables
static or class variables
constant
readonly

variable declared with the key word const is constant

it cannot be modified

static variable can be modified but not constant variable

var

scope of the implicitly typed variable is local, they are declared using the key word var
implicit variable requires initialization
it helps while using linq 
var cannot use null

it was introduced during c# 3.0, they are not replacement for normal variable declaration

var x =null;

in c# 4.0, new type introduced  that is known as  dynamic type and used to avoid compile time checking

difference between var and dynamic

var is part of C# 3.0, it is used as implicit variable

type of the variable is decided at the compile time

initialization is required at the time of declaration, visual studio provides intellisence

it cannot be used for properties or returning values


dynamic - c# 4.0

it does not require initialization, type of the variable is decided at the run time

visual studio does not provide intellisence, it can be used for properties or returning function


Difference between const and readonly
const fields has to be initialized while declaration only, while readonly fields can be initialized at declaration or in the constructor.
const variables can declared in methods ,while readonly fields cannot be declared in methods.
const fields cannot be used with static modifier, while readonly fields can be used with static modifier.
A const field is a compile-time constant, the readonly field can be used for run time constants.

string interpolation

string userName = "Ramesh S B";

var fullname = $"Hello {userName}";

$.ajax {

type:POST,
url:bk/bk,
data:
content: 'application/json'
success: function(data)
