IEnumerable and IQueryable

Difference between IEn and IQe is where the filter logic is applied

In IEnumerable, entire collection is sent to client side and then filter applied. In memory

In IQueryable, filter is applied at the server side and selected record is sent to client. Collection connected to Db

IEnumerable vs IEnumerator
