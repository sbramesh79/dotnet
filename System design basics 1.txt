Syste design interview (Step-by-Step guide)

1. Requirement clarification

	It is always a good idea to ask more questions about the exact scope of the problem. Design questions are open ended, they don't have one correct answer. Better to clarify the ambiguities as much as possible.

2. System interface definition

	Define what api's are expected from the system.  This will not only establish the contract expected from the system, but also ensure if we have missed any requirements.

3. Back of the envelope estimation

	It is always good idea to estimate the scale of the system we are going to design.  Later it will help in scaling, partitioning, caching and load balancing.

4. Defining the data model

	Defining the data model early will clarify how data will flow among different components of the system.  It will guide towards data partitioning  and management. The cadidate should be able to identify various entities of the system, how they will interact with each other and different aspect of the data management like storage, encryption and transportation.

5. High level design

	Draw a block diagram with 5-6 boxes representing the core components of the system.  We should identify  enough components that are needed to solve the actual problem.

6. Detailed design

	Dig deeper into couple of components, explain the different approaches  with pros and cons and explain why prefer that approach.

	How data is stored ?

	Should we partition the data and distribute it to multiple databases?

	What components need better load balancing?

	Where caching should be introduced?

7. Identifying and resolving the bottelnecks

	Is there a single point of failure in the system

	Do we have enough replicas of the data so that if we lose a few servers we can still serve our users

	How are we monitoring the performance of our service

	Do we get alerts whenever critical components fail or their performance degrade?
