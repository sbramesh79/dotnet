Request comes through browser

1. Application start Global.asax ( Routing, bundling, filter

2. Router

3. Application handler
	
	create an instance of controller (
	create temp data provider
	Create Action invoker
	Authentication filter( true or false)
	Authorization filter
	Model binder
	Action and Action filter
	Execute result and execute filter

	controller dispose


Temp data stays for a subsequent http requests as opposed to ViewBag and ViewData

pass data from controller to controller, action to action

ViewBag, ViewData and TempData

ViewBag

Used to pass data from Controller to View, it was introduced in MVC 1.0

Casting is required for complex object

Null check is required

It becomes null after the current request


ViewData

It is wrapper around ViewBag

type casting is not required, value becomes null after current request

it is slow compared to ViewData
